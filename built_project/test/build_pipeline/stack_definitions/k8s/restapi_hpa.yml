# Beta version of the HPA API
# This file aims to manage the horizontal pod autoscaling policy.
# The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller,
#  deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with custom metrics support,
#  on some other application-provided metrics).
